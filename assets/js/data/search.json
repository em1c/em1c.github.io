We have anonymous access to the ftp server right from the start. The ftp server contains sensitive files, from which the attacker ultimately extracts login credentials for the exposed telnet service. The attacker thus gains the user’s flag. In order to escalate the privileges, we use the runas command with the /savecred option in order to use the saved Administrator credentials - this way we get the root flag.PortscanNmap scan report for 10.10.10.98Host is up (0.051s latency).Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimitPORT STATE SERVICE VERSION21/tcp open ftp Microsoft ftpd| ftp-syst: |_ SYST: Windows_NT| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)|_Can't get directory listing: PASV failed: 425 Cannot open data connection.23/tcp open telnet?80/tcp open http Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5| http-methods: |_ Potentially risky methods: TRACE|_http-title: MegaCorp|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/7.5Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windowsWebsiteNothing interesting on the website.

It should be mentioned that in order to download the backup.mdb file in its entirety, you have to switch to binary mode in the ftp client. To do that, just type binary into the console while being in ftp client.┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/…/pentesting/htb/boxes/access]└─# file Access\\ Control.zip Access Control.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=AES Encrypted ┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/…/pentesting/htb/boxes/access]└─# file backup.mdb backup.mdb: Microsoft Access DatabaseWhen we try to unzip the Access Control.zip file we get the following error.Archive: Access Control.zipskipping: Access Control.pst unsupported compression method 99It is due to the fact that unzip does not support unzipping AES encrypted files at this time. Only the 7z tool is able to do this. When trying to extract with the 7z utility, we get a message about the required password. At this point, we do not have a password - we have to get it somehow.Backup.mdbLet’s try opening the downloaded backup using Microsoft Access.
